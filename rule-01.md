## 1. Do not learn if you do not understand

Trying to learn things you do not understand may seem like an utmost nonsense. Still, an amazing proportion of students commit the offence of learning without comprehension. Very often they have no other choice! The quality of many textbooks or lecture scripts is deplorable while examination deadlines are unmovable.

If you are not a speaker of German, it is still possible to learn a history textbook in German. The book can be crammed word for word. However, the time needed for such "blind learning" is astronomical. Even more important: The value of such knowledge is negligible. If you cram a German book on history, you will still know nothing of history.

The German history book example is an extreme. However, the materials you learn may often seem well structured and you may tend to blame yourself for lack of comprehension. Soon you may pollute your learning process with a great deal of useless material that treacherously makes you believe "it will be useful some day".

## 原则一：不理解，不要学

试图去学习一些你自己不理解的材料是完全无意义的。尽管如此，依然有惊人比例的学生去犯这种不理解材料就盲目学习的错误。很多时候他们没有选择，教科书和讲义的质量相当糟糕却又不得不面对临近的考试。

即使你不讲德语，你仍然可以学习用德语写的历史教材。你可以逐字逐句的硬记他，但是这样盲目学习的时间是巨大的。而更为严重的是，这种所谓知识的价值简直微不足道。因为你只是死记硬背了德语教材，但你对历史仍然一无所知。

德语教材只是一个极端的例子。你的学习材料往往看起来组织有序，而你可能因为对这些材料缺乏理解而责备自己。很快，你的学习过程中就会充斥着大量无用的材料，并危险的让你相信：将来总有一天会有用吧？
